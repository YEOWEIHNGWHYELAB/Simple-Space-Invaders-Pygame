# Simple_Space_Invaders_Pygame

This is a game Space Invader of my own version I made after watching the Pygame Tutorial for Beginners - Python Game Development Course on YouTube. I have made some changes to the button control to make it more responsive.
Be Creative, don't need to follow the "Space Ship & Alien" kinda thing... Maybe you could make it into a car game where it need to dodge obstacles...
